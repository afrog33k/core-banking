# Services

This page includes documentation to services provided by the bank, such as
cards, authorization hold and foreign currency conversion.

Cards and authorization hold can be created in the Cards service and the
HoldConfig service allows configuring global and merchant-specific
authorization hold configurations.

Note that the creation and deletion of cards is not managed in this section but
in the respective accounts section.

Fee tables for currency conversion can be managed through the Rates and Rate
service.
