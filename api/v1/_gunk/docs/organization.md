# Organization

This page includes documentations related to the management of the
organization.

Each organization may contain multiple branches, which contains multiple
centres. Each centre can then contain multiple clients.

A client may be an individual client, managed by the Clients service, or a
group client composed from multiple clients, which are managed by the Groups
service.

Comments may be added for all clients by users but they cannot be deleted.

In addition, this page includes holidays for the organization, allowing the
management of non-working days and general holidays (such as a public holiday).
