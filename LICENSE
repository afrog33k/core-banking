                          Version 1.0, September 2022


    1. Preamble

    This License establishes the terms under which the Software under this
    License may be copied, modified, distributed, or redistributed.

    2. Definitions

       2.1. "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Form or
            Object Form, that is based on (or derived from) the Software and
            for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
            other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
            authorship and not an exact or repackaged copy of the Software. It
            includes proprietary complements, add-ons, modules, or
            modifications to the Object Form that link to the interfaces of
            the Software and the Derivative Works thereof. It shall include,
            among others:

            2.1.1. Any software that results from an addition to, deletion
                   from, or modification of the contents of a file containing
                   Original Software or Derivative Works thereof; and

            2.1.2. Any new file that is contributed or otherwise made available
                   under the terms of this License.

            2.1.2. "License" means the terms and conditions for use,
                   reproduction, and distribution as defined in this document.

            2.1.3. "Licensor" shall mean Brankas, its affiliates,
                   subsidiaries, or permitted assigns.

            2.1.4. "Object Form" shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                   transformation or translation of a source form, including
                   but not limited to compiled object code, generated
                   documentation, and conversions to other media types.

            2.1.5. "Original Software" means the Source Code of computer
                   software code that was originally released under this
                   License.

            2.1.6. "Software" means (a) the Original Software; (b) Derivative
                   Works; or (c) the combination of files containing Original
                   Software with files containing Derivative Works, in each
                   case, including portions thereof.

            2.1.7. "Source Code" means (a) the common form of computer software
                   code in which modifications are made, and (b) associated
                   documentation included in or with such code.

            2.1.8. "Source Form" shall mean the preferred form for making
                   modifications, including but not limited to software source
                   code, documentation source, and configuration files.

            2.1.9. "You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
                   rights under this License. For legal entities, "You"
                   includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
                   under common control with you. For purposes of this
                   definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or
                   indirect, to cause the direction or management of an
                   entity, whether by contract or otherwise; or (b) ownership
                   of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares
                   or beneficial ownership of an entity.

    3. Grants

       3.1. Copyright License

            The Licensor grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
            worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use,
            copy, modify, distribute, make available, display, and prepare
            Derivative Works of the Software, in each case subject to the
            limitations and conditions of this License.

            3.1.1. Right to Distribute

                   Subject to Clause 5, you may distribute the Derivative Works
                   of the Software, provided that you have clear documentation
                   as to how your Derivative Works differ from the Original
                   Software. You are not required to make such documentation
                   public.


           3.1.2. Aggregation

                  Subject to Clause 5, you may aggregate the Original Software
                  with Derivative Works in Object Form or Source Form and
                  distribute the resulting aggregation.


       3.2. Patent License

            The Licensor grants You a license, under any patent claims the
            Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to make, have
            made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and have imported the
            software, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions in
            this License.


    4. Effective date

       4.1. The licenses required and granted under Clause 3 with respect to
            any Derivative Works become effective, for each Derivative Works,
            on the date you first distribute such Derivative Works.


    5. Limitations and Conditions of this License

       5.1. You may not, whether by yourself or with other persons, provide
            the Software, whether in a repackaged version thereof or in a
            resulting aggregation with Derivative Works, to a third party as a
            hosted or managed service, including where you will provide access
            to any substantial set of the features or functionality of the
            Software.


    6. Your Responsibilities

       6.1. The Derivative Works that you create or to which you contribute are
            governed by the terms of this License. You represent that the
            Derivative Works are your original creation(s), as clearly
            documented by you, and/or you have sufficient rights to grant the
            rights conveyed by this License.

       6.2. You assume full responsibility for informing the recipients of this
            Software of the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a
            copy of this License.

       6.3. In incorporating Derivative Works into this Software, you must
            include a statement in your license to that effect in the
            aggregated Software.


    7. Termination

       7.1. If you violate the terms of this License, your use is not licensed
            and will result in the termination of the licenses granted to you
            hereunder.

       7.2. If the Licensor provides you with a notice of your violation, you
            shall cease all violations of this license no later than 30 days
            after receipt of that notice and your licenses will be reinstated
            retroactively.

       7.3. If you violate the terms of this License after such reinstatement
            under Clause 7.2, any subsequent violations of these terms will
            result in the termination of your license automatically and
            permanently.

       7.4. This License does not cover any patent claims that you cause to be
            infringed by Derivative Works or additions to the Software. Should
            you make any written claim that the Software infringes or
            contributes to infringement of any patent, the patent license for
            this Software granted under the terms of this License ends
            immediately. If Your representative makes a patent claim, the
            patent license granted under this License likewise ends
            immediately.


    8. Disclaimer of Warranty

       8.1. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the
            Licensor provides the Software on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
            WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
            including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
            TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing Software and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
            License.

    9. Limitation of Liability

       9.1. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
            negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable
            law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
            writing, shall the Licensor be liable to you for damages, including
            any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
            of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
            use or inability to use the Software (including but not limited to
            damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
            malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
            even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
            damages.

    10. General

        10.1. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
              under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
              enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License and
              without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
              shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
              provision valid and enforceable.

        10.2. This License shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting
              as such, and third-party beneficiary rights are specifically
              excluded.

    FAQs on the Brankas Open License

    1. What is the Open Core?

       The APIX Open Core is the first of its kind: a fully functional open
       source, cloud-based, modularized core banking system for the use of
       fintech providers and financial institutions. It allows them to launch
       new and innovative financial services faster and cheaper. Its
       development is supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
       Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) Proof-of-Concept grant
       to Brankas on 11 November 2021.

    2. What does the License cover?

       The Brankas Open License will cover the Open Core Software (Original
       Software), an open-source alternative to commercial core banking
       software systems and pre-configured to support financial institutions.
       The Original Software includes eight (8) modules for essential retail
       and corporate financial services, structured on an API-based
       microservices architecture and with corresponding administrator
       dashboards/user interfaces.

       If you are interested in availing Brankas’ closed-source components, you
       may reach out to our Sales team.

    3. What is the meaning of the limitations set out in Clause 5 of the
       Brankas Open License?

       With the first-of-its-kind, state-of-the-art open-source core banking
       software developed by Brankas, the Original Software can help thousands
       of financial institutions modernize their legacy systems or facilitate
       the entry of fintech providers that need a core banking system.

       However, it is often the case that open source projects like the APIX
       Open Core can be offered by cloud vendors or by third parties as a
       hosted or managed service without adding value to it or giving back to
       the community, repackaging them into proprietary offerings and reaping
       revenues from them.

       While we shall continue to make the Software and its Source Code
       available to the open source community, we have a specific limitation to
       address this problem. Licensees are not permitted  to offer the Software
       or the resulting aggregation (with Derivative Works integrated thereto)
       to third parties as a hosted or managed service.

    4. What modifications or derivative works can you create using the Open
       Core?

       The Brankas Open License maintains all of the freedoms of a permissive
       open source license like Apache License 2.0 or 3-Clause Berkeley
       Software Distribution License. Third parties, including the open source
       community, are encouraged to develop modules/add-ons to the Software as
       doing so actually enriches or adds value to the Software. Such
       modules/add-ons may be considered Derivative Works, which third parties
       may offer as a standalone service (after aggregating with the Original
       Software) to their customers. The only limitation is that you may not
       offer the Software or the resulting aggregation (with Derivative Works
       integrated thereto) as a hosted or managed service under Clause 5.

    5. If services using the Software are offered by a financial
       institution or a fintech provider to the public, will they have to pay
       license fees to Brankas?

       No. Financial institutions or fintech providers, and the open source
       community, may use the Software, develop their proprietary add-ons, and
       build their services from it - then offer such services to their
       customers without paying Brankas license fees, subject only to the
       limitation under Clause 5, that third parties may not offer the Software
       as a hosted or managed software.

    6. What are some configurations falling under Clause 3?

       6.1. I use Open Core internally at my company. How does the License work
            for me?

            You may continue to use the Software for free, as your use has been
            clearly permitted under the License. For closed-source components,
            such as additional modules that have been developed by Brankas and
            are not available under this License, you may reach out to our
            Sales team.

       6.2 I am building add-ons or modular integrations compatible with the
           Open Core. How does the License work for me?

           As you have developed a Derivative Work, you may freely use Software
           and proceed to redistribute it, provided you do not offer the
           Software as a hosted or managed service.

       6.3 I am a financial institution or fintech provider in need of a core
           banking system, and I intend to use Open Core and develop my own
           add-ons. How does the License work for me?

           This is precisely what we hope Open Core will be useful for. Your
           intended use aligns with our vision to enable thousands of financial
           institutions and fintech providers to modernize their legacy systems
           or facilitate their entry into the market, ultimately redounding to
           the benefit of financial consumers.

           For closed-source components, such as additional modules that have
           been developed by Brankas and are not available under this License,
           you may reach out to our Sales team.

       6.4 I intend to offer a managed or hosted core banking service to
           financial institutions, fintech providers or third parties. In doing
           so, I may engage a third party cloud provider or server, or use my
           own cloud services to offer the services to third parties.  How does
           the License work for me?

           This is prohibited under Clause 5 of the License.
